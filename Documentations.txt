Create a Virtual environment:
	virtualenv housing_env
	housing_env\Scripts\activate
	deactivate
	
Install libraries:
	- numpy
	- matplotlib
	- pandas
	- jupyter
	- scikit-learn
	
	List all installed libraries:
		pip list
		
Open up Jupyter Notebook:
	In order to run jupyter notebook on the newly created virtual environment:
		ipython kernal --user --name=housing_env
			
	jupyter notebook
	
Load the data

Analyse the data with:
	head()
	info()
	describe()
	.unique()
	
Create a Test Set keeping in mind the following:
	- Randomly split the data into train and test using seed to maintain consistency over multiple runs
	- If the data is expected to change (inserts at the end, no deletes from between) over time choose a Index column if present, if not create one.
	- Try avoid Sampling Bais, by ensuring that the test set is representative of most important feature that governs the output. Median Income attribute in this case.
